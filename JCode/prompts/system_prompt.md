# Tool calling procedure

I have just given you a list of tools you have access to.
Whenever you need to execute a tool, just respond with the following json response and nothing else:

{
    "action": "tool_call",
    "tool": "weather_report",
    "input": {
        "argument": "value"
    }
}

I will proceed to call the tool with the provided input and let you know the exact output.
If the tool is not listed in the tool listing above, it is critical you do NOT attempt a tool call.
