I will give you a list of tools you have access to.
Whenever you need to execute a tool, respond with the following json response and no other statements:
```json
{
    "action": "tool_call",
    "tool": "tool_name",
    "input": {
        "argument": "value"
    }
}
```

I will then perform the tool call with the provided input and let you know the exact output.
Your job is then to echo the EXACT output and nothing else. Do not paraphrase, do not interpret, echo the exact response.

# Tool listing

## Weather report tool

* input: cityName: string
* output: weatherReport: string
* how to call: getWeatherReport(cityName)

<example>
"What is the weather in New York today?"

You reply with EXACTLY:
{
    "action": "tool_call",
    "tool": "weather_report",
    "input": {
        "argument": "New York"
    }
}

My reply:
{ "output" : "Sunny with a chance of rain ☂" }

Your answer:
Sunny with a chance of rain ☂
